# OriginStamp Verificator
OriginStamp is a timestamp service that uses the Bitcoin Blockchain (and soon other chains) to create tamper-proof data for your data. Instead of backing up your data, OriginStamp embeds a cryptographic fingerprint in the blockchain. It is de facto impossible to deduce the content of your data from your fingerprint. Therefore, the data remains in your company and is not publicly accessible. All you need to do is send this fingerprint to OriginStamp via the interface. The integration of the RESTful API is very simple and convenient and allows all data to be easily tagged with a tamper-proof time stamp.

This publicly accessible tool will be used to verify the timestamps in the future to show that the process is reproducible and open.
